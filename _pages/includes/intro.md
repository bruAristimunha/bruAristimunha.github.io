I am the 4-th-year *Computer Science* Ph.D. student in the [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) (France üá´üá∑) and [Federal University of ABC](https://www.ufabc.edu.br/) (Brazil üáßüá∑), happily advised by Professors [Sylvain Chevallier](https://sylvchev.github.io/), [Marie-Constance Corsi](https://marieconstance-corsi.netlify.app/) and [Raphael Y. de Camargo](https://rycamargo.github.io).

My current research interests include Learning Representation from the time series (Decoding, Generation and Transferability), Brain-Computer Interfaces, Machine Learning/Deep Learning for brain decoding, Benchmark, and Riemannian Geometry (mostly Symmetric Positive Definite Neural Networks).

During my PhD, I have been collaborating with different research groups from the country, such as the United States (San Diego and San Francisco), England, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Canada (Waterloo and MILA), Brazil (Sao Paulo), and of course, France. This led me to produce more than 16 full papers, short papers, reports, and abstracts (*On April 21, 2025,*) at different levels of depth that cover different and complementary angles of the problem of my doctorate. Most of the my papers can be found here on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=2Gd5gOQAAAAJ). Above all, I see the experience of collaborating on self-contained projects and code orientation very enjoyable üß†‚öôÔ∏è. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to contact me by e-mail.

I strongly believe in open source as a way to have reproducible science, which makes us go further through community development, with a small disclaimer of working with closed code sometimes.

I am the lead maintainer of two widely used Python libraries in my research topic, the PyTorch library for biological time series decoding, Braindecode [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/braindecode?color=blue&style=plastic)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/braindecode) and the Mother of all BCI Benchamark - MOABB benchmarking [![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/moabb?color=blue&style=plastic)](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/moabb). In both libraries, I try to actively shaping standards and enabling \emph{EEG decoding}. I try to publicize my research agenda and ways of disseminating it. I have been collaborating and interacting with other open-source libraries from the nearby ecosystem and a little beyond, such as MNE-Python, MONAI, MONAI Generative, Geopt, SpeechBrain and recently EEG Dash.


Talk a little more about code experience and past interships...

About the experience with the community, I organized the [Braindecode Code-Sprint](https://braindecode.org/sprint2023/) during the European summer of 2023, and I am currently leading the [Special Session on Decoding the brain time series](https://mlsp2025-decoding-brain.github.io/) at IEEE International Workshop on
Machine Learning for Signal Processing (MLSP) 2025. 

I have been serving as a reviewer at different machine learning conferences and journals, such as NeurIPS (x2), ICLR, ICML, NeuroImage, Imaging Neuroscience, Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) and Learning from Time Series for Health Workshop@ICLR. However, I decline to review articles in areas I do not understand or are too far outside my own.
